    <h4 class="h4">Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj </h4>&MediumSpace;
    <h4 class="h4-1">Mahal?</h4><br>
    
    <p class="para1"> Quite honestly, we can’t think of one. <br><br><br>
      
      At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than <br> 
      building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br> 
      its magnificence up close.<br><br>

      After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <a href="india.html"><span class="span1">India</span></a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s  <br>
      the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj  <br>
      Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from  <br>
      Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders - to cover all the bases. <br><br>
      
      Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br>
      and so much more…

<section class="section2"><br>
  <h2 class="h-2">Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h2><br>
  <p class="para2">That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br><br>br

    Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian  <br>
    men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you. <br><br>
    
    To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br>
    Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <span class="span1">8-day Golden Triangle tours</span> (now with <span class="span1">solo-only <br>
    departures</span>!) to <span class="span1">15-day trips dedicated to food</span>, to 19-day trips combining the <span class="span1">highlights of India <br>
    and Nepal.</span> <br><br>
    
    If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from <br> 
    Delhi. Check out <span class="span2"> Urban Adventures</span> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while  <br>
    you’re at it, check out their day trips in <span class="span1"> Delhi</span>, <span class="span1">Jaipur</span>,<span class="span2">Varanasi</span>  
    and <span class="span2"> Mumbai</span>!</p><br><br>

    <p class="para2-1">The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally <br>
       prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p><br>

       <h4>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h4><br>
       <p class="para2-1">Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br>
         minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in. <br><br>

        You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Passport</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Money</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Water</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Medicine</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Camera</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Phone</li><br>
        </ul>

</section>

<section class="section3">
  <h4 class="h-4">What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h4><br>
  <p class="para3">There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br>
    need to cover your head, shoulders and knees. <br><br>

    It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear  <br>
    sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too. <br><br>
    
    If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid  <br>
    the worst of the heat. <br><br>

    <p class="para3-1">
      Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p> <br><br>

    <img src="eps10-blue-quotation-mark-icon-isolated-on-white-background-double-quotes-symbol-in-a-simple-flat-trendy-modern-style-for-your-website-design-logo-ui-pictogram-and-mobile-application-vector-removebg-p (1).png" class="quotation" height="40px" width="40px">
     <p class="para3-2"> 
      Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are <br>
        easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are <br>
        to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of <br>
        laces are hard!</p> <br><br>

        <h4 class="otherh4">Other things you need to know</h4><br>


      <p class="para4">
        
      
      No food is allowed inside. <br><br>
      
      Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed. <br><br>
      
      Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. <br>
      Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br>
      video cameras) are not allowed. <br><br>
      
      Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your  <br>
      wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p><br>

  <h3 class="sech4">When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
  <p class="para5">
    Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br>
     possible). <br><br>
  </p>

  <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" class="image4" height="450px" width="800px"><br><br>
  <br>
  <p class="para5">
    If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br>
    amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br>
    take you there and back cheaply.) <br><br>
    
    And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br>
    (or more!) remain in awe of it. <span class="span1">Sana Jinah</span>, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has <br>
     some tips on how to do this:</p><br>

     <img src="eps10-blue-quotation-mark-icon-isolated-on-white-background-double-quotes-symbol-in-a-simple-flat-trendy-modern-style-for-your-website-design-logo-ui-pictogram-and-mobile-application-vector-removebg-p (1).png" class="quotation" height="40px" width="40px">
     <p class="para5-1">

      The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m <br>
      done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to <br>
      make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then <br>
      they will no longer be surprises! <br>
      The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the <br>
      sunlight). It’s so beautiful…<br><br>

      <p class="para5">
        She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise <br>
        on a clear day. <br>

  <h3 class="sec5h3">Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
  <p class="para5">
    Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>
    on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop. <br>

    <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" class="image5" height="450px" width="800px">

    <p class="para5">
      But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>
      seeking out. <br><br>

      Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span class="span1">Pravin <br>
        Tamang</span>. (His photography is amazing –  <span class="span1">check it out</span>!)</p><br><br>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway.</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main <br>
            platform.</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river.</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj.</li>&MediumSpace;
          <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort.</li>&MediumSpace;
        </ul>

        <p class="para5">
          You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>
           Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br>
           day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!. <br><br>

           <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_fog-taj-mahal.jpg" class="image5" height="450px" width="800px"> <br>
           <br>
           <h3 class="sec5h3">What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3> <br>
           <p class="para5">First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br>
            explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p> <br>

            <h4 class="sec5h3">What to do in Agra</h4><br>

            <p class="para5">
              The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort <br>
              is also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br>
              Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed. <br><br>

              Despite being located on the <span class="span1">Golden Triangle</span> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in <br>
               many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br>
               likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip. <br><br>

              
              One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br>
              (sometimes) taking travelers to  <span class="span1">Sheroes Hangout</span>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe <br>
               run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their <br>
                stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>

              <h4 class="sec5h3">Where to go outside of Agra</h4>
              <p class="para5">There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, <br>
                Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places. <br><br>

                Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>
                and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br>
                 it on  <span class="span1">this 15-day trip</span> from <span class="span1">Delhi to Kathmandu</span>  
                 (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p><br>

                 <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" class="image6" height="450px" width="800px"><br>

                 <p class="imagename">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p><br><br>
                 <p class="para5">Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <span class="span1">‘Pink City’</span>, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br>
                  chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br>
                   bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in. <br><br>
                  

                  Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home  <br>
                  to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy <br>
                   nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this <span class="span1">15-day trip</span> all around Rajasthan.</p><br><br>





                   <h3 class="sec5h3">A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3><br>
                   <p class="para5">As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br>
                     clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018. <br><br>
                    

                    Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>
                     surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work –  <br>
                     applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried  <br>
                     out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>
                     carried out on the historic site.</p><br><br>
